       1    tablespoon  Sugar
       1                Lime
      50            ml  Cachaça Liquor
       4                Icecube

Cut the lime into thin slices (8ths and leave some of the peel) and put
at least four slices of it in a glass for whiskey and add the sugar. Add the crushed icecubes to the glass. Now add the pinga (a distilled drink from sugarcane). Make sure the
alcohol just covers the lime pieces and mash this mixture well, using a
little wooden stick or pettle.When the alcohol is slightly green
and the limes look pretty wrecked, it's ready for use.
