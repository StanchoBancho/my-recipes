   2 1/2        ounces  chocolate 
       2   tablespoons  coffee
       2   tablespoons  kahlua
       2                eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
       1         pinch  cream

       3        ounces  bittersweet chocolate
      24                decorative leaf

For the Mousse: In the top of a double boiler, set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolates with the coffee and the Kahlua, stirring occasionally. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 3 tb. of the sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and stir in the chocolate mixture. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in the remaining 1 tb. sugar gradually and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the remaining whites and the whipped cream, gently but thoroughly. Pour the mousse into a 1 qt. shallow dish and chill, covered, for at least two hours. (This may be made a day in advance) Before serving, arrange some of the chocolate leaves on the mousse, and serve the remaining leaves separately. Chocolate leaves: In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate. with a spoon, coat the back (non-shiny) side of each leaf with the chocolate, being careful not to let the chocolate drip onto the shiny side. Place the leaves, chocolate side up on a jelly roll pan lined with wax paper, and prop the edges of the leaves with pieces of foil or paper towel to allow the edges to curl.  Chill the leaves for 20 minutes, or until the chocolate has hardened, and, working quickly, peel off the lemon leaves. (If the chocolate gets too soft, chill the leaves for 5 minutes more, or until hardened). Keep the leaves chilled until just before serving. Makes 24 leaves.

Over very hot water, melt chocolate with hot coffee. (I melt the chocolate in the microwave--High for 1 minute--and then stir in coffee.) Add liquor. (Original recipe called for rum.) Add egg yolks, and beat very well. Beat egg whites separately and fold chocolate mixture into whites. Pour into sherbet glasses and chill. Serves 4-6. NOTE:  The first 4 ingredients may be combined in blender and mixed on high speed for about 1 minutes. (This is how I do it.) Garnish with dollop of non-dairy Cool Whip and some shaved chocolate. I like to serve it in stemmed glasses.

     1/2           cup  butter

Stew the fruit, sweeten to taste and pour into a 9x9 cake pan. I frequently do this in the microwave. Sift dry cake ingredients together.  Mix the egg, milk and butter and stir gently into the flour mixture. Pour the cake mixture over the rhubarb and cook at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown. For a real cholesterol disaster, pour heavy cream over this while warm for serving.  It tastes great without it but I like the cream for company. The cake can be baked by itself in an 8x8 pan. Bake about 20 - 25 minutes. It makes a wonderful shortcake for fruit. The cookbook (Fanny Farmer) calls it Cottage Pudding.

       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2        ounces  kahlua
       2        ounces  rum

Whip heavy cream until stiff. Whip egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until pale yellow. Add mascarpone and whip until mixed well. Whip in the stiffly beaten heavy cream until all is mixed well. Use almost any size container, usually a 9 x 13 clear dish. Put half of the cheese mixture on the bottom, spreading evenly. Mix the coffee with the kahlua, rum and 2 tbls sugar. Soak the lady fingers, with the coffee mix, one at a time, until they absorb some of the liquid, but still feel a little crisp. Place the soaked lady fingers over the cheese layer in the dish. Top with the rest of the cheese mixture and smooth over all with the back of a spoon. Coarsely chop some bittersweet chocolate and sprinkle it over the top. Let stand chilled at least 6 hours before serving.

       8        ounces  cream cheese
   1 1/2          cups  powdered sugar

Cut the cake across the middle to form 2 halves. Blend the coffee and kahlua together. Sprinkle the one half of the cake with the coffee and kahlua mix, enough to strongly flavor the cake, but do not saturate the cake so much that it collapses. Mix the cream cheese and sugar, beating until light and spreadable. Spread over this half of the cake in a fairly thick layer. Set the other half on top of this. Repeat the process. Put the cocoa powder in a wire strainer and coat the top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa. Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving. May use favorite liqueur or rum or brandy instead of kahlua.

Cream yolks and sugar until smooth. Add mascarpone cheese and mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Fold in cream (or whipped topping). Combine coffee and brandy in a bowl. Dip 15 ladyfingers, one by one into brandy mixture and line up on a platter to make a rectangle about 7x13". Cover with 1/2 the mascarpone/cream mixture. Repeat with another layer and top with remaining cream mixture. Sift chocolate on top. With remaining ladyfingers, cut them in half and arrange around your rectangle with cut side down. The cream acts as a "glue".

Soak cherries in rum. Sift sugar; cocoa, and instant coffee together and place in a heavy sauce pan. Add the water and mix well. Bring to a boil and cook until everything is well mixed. While syrup is cooking, whip the egg yolks until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed of the beaters to the lowest level and add the hot syrup in a continuous fine stream. Continue beating until the mixture is thick and forms a ribbon pattern when the beater is pulled away. Chill well. Whip the cream with the 2 tablespoons of rum until stiff. Fold into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the chopped chocolate. Arrange foil lined paper cups in a muffin pan. Fill each cup 1/3 of the way full. Place a cherry in each cup then fill the rest of the way. Freeze at least 4 hrs. Before serving pipe whipping cream on top if desired. It will keep in the freezer for about a month.

       2   tablespoons  vanilla
       4                egg yolk

NOTE:  To make a lighter ice cream, use 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of cream.  To make a richer ice cream, add 2 more egg yolks.

 In a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, milk, sugar and vanilla beans.  (If you're using vanilla extract, do not add it until later on in the recipe.)  Stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved and mixture is hot but not boiling.

 Whisk yolks together in bowl.  Continue whisking and very slowly pour in about 1 cup of the cream mixture.  When smooth, pour back into to the saucepan.

 Whisk constantly over low heat until mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon (about 5 minutes).  Take care that mixture doesn't boil, or it will curdle.  Draw your finger across the back of the coated spoon.  If the line you make remains, custard is done.

 Remove vanilla beans; or is you're using vanilla extract, add it now.

 Freeze in ice cream churn according to manufacturer's instructions.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Bring water to a boil; add the salt and butter.  Break the butter up to speed melting.  It is important that as little as possible of the water boil away.

Dumb the flour into the boiling liquid and stir rapidly.  As soon as the mixture holds together and looks like corn meal mush, remove it from the heat.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until the mixture is smooth.

Droop by tablespoonfuls onto a shiny cookie sheet.  Allow room for expansion.

Bake at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake for 20 minutes longer, or until golden and crisp.

Remove to cooling racks.  Make a slit in each puff or cut off the top to spread cooling and drying.

In a small saucepan melt sugar over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. 
Heat oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will fall as a liquid sauce over the custard.

       1           cup  sugar
       2   tablespoons  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

In large bowl combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Heat water, sour cream and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (With Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)
Prepare Almond Filling: Combine almond paste with 1 egg white. Beat with fork until blended. Stir in chopped, blanched almonds, toasted.
Punch dough down. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 9- W 16-inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2-inch of edges; sprinkle with cherries. Roll up from long side as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Form into ring and pinch ends to seal. Place ring, seam side down, on greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, 3/4 through dough, at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

       1      Teaspoon  Aga
   2 1/2          Cups  Water
     3/4           Cup  Butter
     1/4           Cup  Honey
       1      Teaspoon  Vanilla
       1    Tablespoon  Lemon Juice

Put the agar and water in a saucepan and heat until agar granules are dissolved. Agar flakes may require simmering several minutes before they are ready; follow the directions on the jar. When agar water is ready, remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. Put agar water and remaining ingredients into a blender and whip for one minute. Pour the mixture into an ice cream freezer. Following the freezer instructions, freeze until firm. Store ice cream in the refrigerator freezer until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Omit one cup of water and add one cup of fruit pulp just before pouring into the freezer. Bananas, strawberries, or peaches make excellent fruit-flavored ice creams. For carob ice cream, add 1/4 cup carob flour. Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for a delicious flavor and a crunchy texture. Substitute any kind of nut or seed butter for cashew butter.

Beat in the vanilla and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form when the beaters are slowly lifted. Fold the egg white mixture into the whipped cream. Then fold in the peanut butter mixture. Pour half of the peanut butter mixture into the peanut butter cookie crust. Drizzle half of the chocolate mixture over the filling. Top with the remaining filling. Drizzle the remaining chocolate in parallel lines over the filling. Pull a knife across the lines at 1 inch intervals. Freeze until firm.
Wrap securely in aluminum foil. Return to the freezer and continue freezing 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving.

CAKE:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 

In a small saucepan, combine mint-chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Cool 10 minutes. 

In medium bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; beat until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in chocolate mixture. Gradually beat in flour mixture alternately with remaining 1 cup of water. Pour into 2 greased and floured 9-inch round baking pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cakes test done. Cool completely on wire racks. Fill and frost with Chocolate Mint Frosting. Garnish as desired.

       5        quarts  popped popcorn
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup

      24                gumdrop
       2                licorice string

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.

       1       package  Yeast
     1/4           cup  Water
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/3           cup  Butter
       1    tablespoon  Orange Juice
       2     teaspoons  Rum Extract
       1           cup  Milk
       2         large  Egg

Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. 
Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl. Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes).
About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.
Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut. Force about 1/2 teaspoon of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.
