     1/4           cup  black eyed bean
     1/4           cup  garbanzo bean
     1/4           cup  pink bean

     1/2      teaspoon  herb
       1           cup  tomato

To soak beans:  For each pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups hot
water.  Up to 2 teaspoons of salt per pound of beans may be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.  Heat to boiling, let boil 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least one hour, but preferably
four hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater amount of sugars to dissolve, thus helping the beans to be more easily digested.  Always discard the soak water.  To maintain color integrity, soak beans separately. 

Drain beans.  Cook onion, celery, carrot, green pepper, parsley and garlic in
butter until soft.  Combine cooked vegetables with soup mix, 2 quarts water,
bay leaf, fine herbs and soaked beans.  Simmer, covered, about 1 hour to
desired tenderness.  Add tomato.  Serve hot, sprinkled with cheese.

       6                chili
       3           cup  water
       1       package  soy
       2   tablespoons  oil
       1                onion
       1         clove  garlic
       1    tablespoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper
       1    tablespoon  paprika
      12           cup  water

Wash, stem and remove seeds from the chilies.  Put chilies in 3 cups cold water and bring to a boil.
After about 45 minutes to an hour the skins should slip off easily.  Mash the pulp into a paste.  If this
seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of 1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of
chili. Read the instructions on the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand.  If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient.  

Saute the onions in the olive oil until translucent.  Add the garlic and spices , then the 12 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour.  If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in tortillas.  When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.

     1/4         pound  small shrimp
     1/2         pound  fish fillets
     1/4         pound  clams
       3          cups  fish stock
       1           cup  clam juice
     1/2           cup  burgundy wine
       1    tablespoon  corn oil

Many recipes come out of the Caribbean that people either like or hate on first taste.  This particular recipe is for a chowder that is excellent.  Heat the oil in a large soup pot.  

Saute the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent.  Add all of the other ingredients except the shrimp, clams and  the fish. Simmer for 1 hour or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the seafood and cook for 7 to 10 minutes at a low boil.

   1 1/2        pounds  chicken
       1                onion
       1         pound  mushroom
       1         bunch  collard green
       6        ounces  tomato

Stem and chop greens.  Put chicken, onion and mushrooms in soup pot.  Add enough water to just barely cover ingredients.  Turn on medium-high heat.  Cover and cook while you're washing and chopping the greens, about 10 minutes.  Add salt, red pepper and tomato paste.  Boil for about another 5 or 10 minutes.  Add greens and replace lid, steaming greens and stirring them in. Variations: sometimes we add some exotic ingredients like smoked fish and/or ground egusi (which is a kind of melon seed), but it's perfectly tasty without these additions. This is traditionally served with "fufu" which is a doughy starch made variously from gari (roasted, fermented, ground cassava), or from semolina flour or from various combinations of Bisquick, potato Buds, potato starch, etc. It's also good over rice.

                     Aromatic Shrimp Creole

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2   tablespoons  oil
       2                onion
       2        cloves  garlic
       4                celery
       2        	green bell pepper
       6   tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
       6          cups  chicken stock
   1 1/2        pounds  shrimp
       1      teaspoon  black pepper
       4          cups  rice
     1/4           cup  parsley

TO COOK: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add the next 5 ingredients; sauti
until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add next 4 ingredients; saute
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock; bring to boil and cook
over medium-high heat until thickened, about 30 minutes. Add shrimp;
simmer until shrimp are opaque throughout, about 4 minutes. Season with
1/2 teaspoon pepper or to taste.

TO SERVE: Ladle a portion of shrimp creole into each warm soup plate.
Spoon 3/4 cup rice atop each portion of creole. Sprinkle with parsley and
serve immediately.

The Pipers call this dish a "white creole" because it is not thickened
with the traditional mahogany-colored roux. Instead, a mixture of chicken
stock, tomato paste, and aromatic vegetables is reduced until the sauce
becomes quite thick and flavorful. It is best to serve this shrimp creole
with steamed white rice.

       2         clove  garlic
       2   tablespoons  oil
       2         pound  asparagus
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
       4           cup  vegetable broth 
       4                egg
     1/2           cup  parmesan
       6         slice  Italian bread

In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  

Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle. Remove from the heat.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.  

Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or slightly stale bread.

NOTES : The above recipe is based on an Indonesian dish traditionally made with peanuts. We are using almonds here. Peanuts are not recommended. A fungus called aflatoxin naturally occurs in the peanut crop. Although the crops are inspected for it, a certain percentage is allowed and since it is a proven carcinogen, peanuts are best left alone. Another reason peanut butter isnt recommended is that it is not possible to make a butter out of raw peanuts. Peanut butter is produced from roasted peanuts.

                     Chestnut Soup With Amaretto

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         pound  chestnut
       2                carrot
       2                parsnips
       1                onion
       1         clove  garlic
       2                scallion
       3         stalk  celery
       4   tablespoons  butter
       5          cups  brown stock
       3   tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
       1          cups  cream
       1      teaspoon  salt

Make a slash in the rounded side of each chestnut and roast in a pre- heated 400 F. oven for 5 minutes.  Peel off the shell and inner skin. Peel the carrots,  parsnip, onion, and garlic.  Finely chop all of the vegetables, including the scallions and celery.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  

Add the vegetables and cook for five minutes, or until soft but not brown.  Add the chestnuts, stock, and bouquet garni. Gently simmer the soup for 40 minutes, or until the chestnuts are very soft.  Remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup in a blender or food processor.  Return the soup to the  saucepan, adding the amaretto, two- thirds of the cream, and salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to taste; the soup should be very flavorful.  

If a   sweeter flavor is desired, add a spoonful of brown sugar.  To serve, ladle the chestnut soup into warmed bowls.  Pour a little of the remaining cream into each bowl and marble it into the soup, stirring with a skewer.  Chestnut soup is extremely rich, so keep the rest of the meal simple.
