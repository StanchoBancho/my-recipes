In a small bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt, basil and pepper. Melt remaining butter in skillet until foamy, swirling it around pan to coat evenly.  When hot enough that a drop of water sizzles when dropped in, pour in egg mixture.  Tip pan so eggs coat skillet evenly. As eggs cook, periodically lift up cooked edges, tilt pan and let uncooked egg run underneath. When eggs are cooked, but surface is still shiny, place asparagus and mushrooms on one side; slide out of pan, folding side without vegetables over top.

   2 1/4        pounds  asparagus
       1                onion
     1/4           cup  butter
   1 1/4          cups  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine
       1                bouillon cube
     1/2      teaspoon  meat extract
       1    tablespoon  butter

Soak and rinse the asparagus. Cut off the tips and put aside. Boil the stalks in lightly salted water. When tender, press the stalks through a sieve and return the pulp to the cooking water. Keep hot. Finely chop the onion. Melt the butter in a saucepan and gently fry the onion and the asparagus tips for a few minutes. Add the rice, mixing and turning with a wooden spoon until the grains are coated in the fat. Pour the wine over the rice, raise the heat and boil briskly until the wine has evaporated. Dilute the bouillon cube and the meat extract in the hot asparagus water. Add a little of the liquid to the  rice, lower the heat, stir and add more liquid as it reduces, until the rice is al dente. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, glaze the rice with 1 tbsp butter and add the grated cheese. Stir well and serve immediately.

     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Cut steak lengthwise in 2-1/2-inch strips, trimming off fat as you go. Then cut across the grain, in 1/8-inch thick strips. Put meat in bowl and add 1 teaspoon salt, cornstarch, and 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Wash asparagus carefully, break off tough ends, and cut diagonally into pieces about 1/4-inch thick.  (If you cat on a SHARP DIAGONAL, the pieces will be abut 1-1/2 to 2" long.) Cut onions in half lengthwise, lay cut side down, and slice crosswise into 1/4" slices. Smash garlic cloves with flat side of knife or cleaver and remove skin. Heat a wide frying pan or wok over highest heat, add 1/4 cup oil, it should bubble slightly from the heat. Add garlic and cook just until pale brown. Remove and discard. Add meat, stir frequently, and cook until almost browned. Remove to a bowl. Add 3 tablespoons more oil.  Add onion.  Cook a minute or two stirring constantly.  Make a little hollow on top of the onion; add bean sauce. Cook until onion starts to get translucent. Add asparagus and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon salt, sugar and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Cover and cook, taking the top off occasionally to stir well, just until asparagus is tender-crisp. Then, put the meat on top. Cook, stirring,just long enough to get the meat reheated. Serve at once. *TIPS: This is usually served over white rice. I always add more garlic, usually with the onion, and leaving it in. You can experiment with using flavored oil in part. Also, try a different Asian sauce if you have it on hand.

       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       2        cloves  garlic
       2        pounds  asparagus
       1         quart  chicken broth
       4                egg
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese
       6        slices  Italian bread

Heat the oil and garlic in a soup pot until the garlic is golden. Add the asparagus and cook until they begin to color.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the broth and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 15  minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.  Beat the eggs and cheese together.  

When the asparagus is tender, reduce the heat so the soup is no longer simmering.  Very slowly ladle some of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously.  After adding about 2 cups of the hot soup to the eggs, reverse the process and gradually stir the eggs mixture into the soup pot.  

The soup must not boil or the eggs will scramble.  Heat until thickened. Put one slice of toasted bread into each soup dish.  Ladle the hot soup on top and pass additional grated cheese.

                     Asparagus and Chicken In Black Bean Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2                chicken thigh
      12        medium  asparagus spear
       3   tablespoons  peanut 
       1    tablespoon  sherry
       1      teaspoon  cornstarch
       2     teaspoons  soy sauce
       1         pinch  sugar
       2     teaspoons  black bean
       3        cloves  garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  brown sugar
       2     teaspoons  soy sauce
     3/4           cup  chicken stock

Marinating: With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice into thin strips across the grain. (Breast meat is not preferred for this dish, as meat is too dry and spongy).

Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15 to 30 minutes.

Preparation: Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off ends; slice on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse fermented black beans. In bowl, combine and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and
chicken stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes.

Stir Frying: Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken. Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to shrink and firm up. Remove chicken to holding bowl.

Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil. When oil is hot, add black bean sauce. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix with sauce. Stir sauce with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked chicken; toss to combine.

Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed; cornstarch in chicken marinade might be enough. Toss ingredients until very little liquid remains and is reduced to glaze. Dish is ready when asparagus brightens.

If you still have too much liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce, then return ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual portions.

Add mushrooms and stir fry for 2-5 more minutes. Add the vinegar mixture (giving it a last stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir until evenly coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately.

     1/3           cup  parsley
       3   tablespoons  butter
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  pepper
     1/4           cup  butter
       3                leek
     1/2      teaspoon   thyme
       1                bay leaf
       6          cups  chicken stock 
   1 1/2        pounds  potato
       1         pound  asparagus

Parsley butter: Mix the first 4 ingredients in small bowl. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using).  Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter in heavy large saucepan over low heat. Add leeks, thyme and bay leaf.  Cover and cook until leeks are soft, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Mix in stock and potatoes. Bring to boil. 

Reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes. Add asparagus and simmer until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Top each with dollop of parsley butter and serve.  This sounded very good, but my husband likes cream soups, so I added a FL sweet onion to the potato  mixture and pureed all before I added the asparagus to  the creamy soup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  Asparagus
       2   tablespoons  Butter
       1  small  Clove  Garlic
     1/2         pound  Mushroom
       4                Egg
       2   tablespoons  Milk
     1/2      teaspoon  Salt
     1/4      teaspoon  basil
       1          Dash  black pepper

Cut asparagus into 1 inch pieces; cook in boiling salted water until tender, about 2 to 4 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 8-inch skillet, preferably one with non-stick lining; saute garlic and mushrooms until done and moisture has evaporated. Remove from pan; keep warm.
In a small bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt, basil and pepper. Melt remaining butter in skillet until foamy, swirling it around pan to coat evenly. When hot enough that a drop of water sizzles when dropped in, pour in egg mixture. Tip pan so eggs coat skillet evenly. As eggs cook, periodically lift up cooked edges, tilt pan and let uncooked egg run underneath. When eggs are cooked, but surface is still shiny, place asparagus and mushrooms on one side; slide out of pan, folding side without vegetables over top. Serve immediately.
