--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  steak
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
       1      teaspoon  red pepper

                        flour

       1                celery
       1           cup  beef stock

Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over all. When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide. For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic before smothering.

   1 1/2        pounds  Steak
       2   tablespoons  Butter
       2   tablespoons  Scallion
       1           cup  Red Wine

Sprinkle flank steak with salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Heat a wide heavy skillet. Do not add fat. When hot, cook seasoned steak until seared and well browned on each side (about 1 minute per side). Reduce heat and add 2 tablespoons butter. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side. For best results, the meat should be quite rare. Remove the meat from the pan and keep warm.
Pour off the fat in the skillet and add the scallions and red wine. Bring to a boil and whisk in the garlic puree. Boil until the wine is reduced by half, thickened, and syrupy. As it boils, scrape up the browned bits in the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in the meat juices that have accumulated under the flank steak. Boil for 1 or 2 seconds more. Remove from the heat. Gently swirl in the 2 tablespoons softened butter so that it incorporates into the wine. Quickly slice the meat, against the grain, into thin strips. Arrange the slices on a hotplatter, pour sauce down the center of them and serve at once.

    2       pound       rib

    2       Tbsp        sugar
    3       Tbsp        vinegar
    4       Tbsp        soy sauce
    5       Tbsp        water

Directions:

Heat a large skillet with some oil in it, and start to brown the spare
ribs.  Once the ribs are seared and browned, add the rest of the
ingredients. Mix well and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to
medium-low.  Cook for about 20-25 minutes, and it's ready to serve!

Note:

When cutting the spare ribs into thirds, you can do it with a
well-sharpened cleaver.  However, getting the butcher to saw them with a
belt saw is usually better, as the cleaver creates bone fragments which
are unpleasant when eating the ribs. The saw, on the other hand, makes a
nice clean cut.

                     Red-Cooked Pot Roast (Shanghai Pot Roast)

Recipe By     :

Categories    : Beef                             Chinese                          
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        pounds  Chuck roast
       1    tablespoon  Sherry
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
       1           cup  Water
       2        slices  Ginger
       2        cloves  Garlic
       1         ounce  Sugar

Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water for a minute or so. Put it into a heavy kettle into which it fits fairly snugly.

Add all the rest of the ingredients (ginger slices, star anise, and garlic should be at the bottom of the pot).

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered, turning and basting occasionally, for 3 hours or until tender.

Serve sliced, hot or cold. If cold, you may want to weight it down with a brick covered in foil or some similarly heavy item while chilling it in the fridge.

You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2 1/2 hr.

For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for pork double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the star anise, and use up to 4 oz of sugar to taste.
