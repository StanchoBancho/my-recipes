--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      24         whole  chicken wing
       8                scallion
       4                pepper
       2   tablespoons  vinegar
       1    tablespoon  spice
       4                garlic 
       2     teaspoons  thyme
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

1. Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry. Cut off and discard pointed tip of each wing and halve wings at the main joint. 2. In a food processor, combine scallions, jalapeno peppers, vinegar, allspice, garlic, thyme, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Process until well blended. With machine on, slowly pour in oil and puree until a thick paste forms. 3. In a large bowl, combine chicken wings and jerk paste. Toss until wings are well coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight 4. Preheat broiler. Arrange wings on broiler pan about 6 inches from heat and broil, turning once, until nicely browned outside and cooked through, about 20 minutes total. Serve warm or at room temperature with lime wedges and lots of napkins. The name of this recipe is no reflection on the cook; jerk is a fiery Jamaican marinade for chicken, pork, or beef.
