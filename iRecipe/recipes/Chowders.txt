       1           cup  corn kernel

Instructions In large heavy saucepan, heat oil and sherry until bubbling. Add onion and saute 5 minutes.  (If mixture appears dry, add 1-2 tsp. water.)  Add carrot, celery, bay leaf, potatoes & stock. Cover, bring to boil & cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, or until potato is tender.

     1/2           cup  wine
       1    tablespoon  corn oil
       3        cloves  garlic 
       3        stalks  celery 
       1                potato 
     1/3           cup  tomatoes 
       1                green bell pepper 
     1/2      teaspoon  basil
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
       2                bay 
       1      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  cilantro 

Many recipes come out of the Caribbean that people either like or hate on first taste.  This particular recipe is for a chowder that is excellent.  Heat the oil in a large soup pot.  

Saute the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent.  Add all of the other ingredients except the shrimp, clams and  the fish. Simmer for 1 hour or until the vegetables are tender.  Add the seafood and cook for 7 to 10 minutes at a low boil.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  pork
       1         quart  water
   1 1/2          cups  onion

Dice the onions and salt pork, then saute slowly in an iron frying pan.  Empty into a chowder pan. Add a quart (more or less) of water and bring it to a boil. Add the diced potatoes and bring back to a boil. Put the clams through a meat grinder then add to the pot. Simmer until done. Add salt and pepper. When done, add the evaporated milk. Turn off heat and let set. Heat again just before serving. Serve with Crackers. (I made this one with canned chopped clams and  it was good!)
