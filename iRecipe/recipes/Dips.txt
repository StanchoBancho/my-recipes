Arrange prepared artichoke bottoms on top of braising sweet anise. Cover; heat artichokes through, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add a tablespoon of water, as needed to keep food moist.

Remove artichoke bottoms from pan. Hold warm.

In a food processor or blender, puree the cooked sweet anise, chick peas, salt, pepper, and cayenne.
