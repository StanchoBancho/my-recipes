  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4 3/4          cups  flour
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       2      packages  Yeast
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
       1           cup  water
     1/3           cup  butter
       4                egg

In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, undissolved yeast and salt. Add very warm water and butter; blend well. Stir in 3 eggs, 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white) and enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.

Divide dough into two equal pieces. Reserve one piece. Divide remaining dough into three equal pieces; roll to 12-inch ropes. Place ropes on greased baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal. Repeat with remaining dough to make second loaf. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Lightly beat reserved egg white, brush on loaves. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake at 400:F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done; switch positions of sheets in oven halfway through baking time. Cover with foil if needed during last 5 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from sheets; cool on wire racks. 

Preparation Time: 45 minutes, excluding rising time. 
Cooking Time: 20 to 25 minutes

                     Ginger and Sesame- Scented Rack of Lamb

Categories    : International                    Lamb                             
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         stalk  ginger 
       2  medium clove  garlic
       1         large  orange
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  sesame oil
       2         racks  lamb

PREPARATION: Peel the ginger and garlic. Remove two 1-inch by 3-inch strips of zest from the orange. Squeeze 1/3 cup orange juice into the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and process until smooth. Put the lamb in a large bowl and rub the meat with the ginger paste. Refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours, turning the racks occasionally in the seasoning paste.

COOKING: Bring meat to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to high position and heat oven to 450:F. Wrap the rib bones in foil to prevent blackening and put the racks meat-side up in a shallow roasting pan. Spread any remaining ginger paste over the meat and roast for 10 minutes. Lower oven to 350:F and roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130:F (medium rare), 15-20 minutes.

SERVING: Let racks rest 5 minutes, cut into chops and serve immediately.

Serves: 4 to 6

Prep Time: More than 1 day

NOTES : Ask the butcher to remove the chine bone from each rack, to trim and "french" the ribs, remove the fell, and trim the fat to no more than 1/4-inch in thickness. To present the racks standing upright, slice a thin wedge of meat off the bottom of the eye. This creates a flat base and simplifies carving

       1         large  egg

To make dough: Measure 2 eggs, milk, butter, water, salt, 3 1/4 cups flour, sugar, lemon peel and yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To make topping: Combine almond paste, 1/4 cup flour and 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white); knead 5 to 6 times or until smooth. Form into 1/2-inch balls; set aside.

To shape: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Divide dough in half. For wings, roll one half of dough to 10 W 5-inch oval. Arrange in center of greased large baking sheet, curving ends downward. For body, roll remaining half of dough to a triangle, 15 inches high and 6 inches wide (at base); place on center of oval. Fold over top third of triangle from left to right; shape to form dove head. Fold over bottom third of triangle from right to left to form tail. With sharp knife, slash wings and tail at 1-inch intervals to form feathers. 

Lightly beat reserved egg white; brush on dough. Arrange almond paste balls, 1/2 inch apart, on body, tail and wings. Press one slivered almond into each ball. Press clove into head for eye. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

Bake at 325:F for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5        quarts  popped popcorn
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  vinegar

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.
