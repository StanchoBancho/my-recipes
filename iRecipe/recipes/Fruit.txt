   1 1/2          cups  flour
     3/4           cup  sugar  
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg

     1/2           cup  milk
       1      teaspoon  vanilla

Prepare Walnut Streusel (Recipe follows).  Pat about half the streusel into a greased, flour-dusted 9-inch tube pan or layer cake pan with a removable bottom; set aside.

Spread half the batter in streusel-lined pan; sprinkle with remaining streusel, then spread with remaining batter. Bake in a 350 degrees oven until a pick inserted in center comes out clean (about 45 to 60 minutes).  Let cool in pan for 20 minutes, then remove pan sides.  Dust with powdered sugar.  Serve warm or cool. *Walnut Streusel: Mix 1/2 cup each     walnuts and firmly packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons   flour, 2 teaspoons   cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons   butter or margarine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1       package  Yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  butter
       1                egg
     1/2           cup  cherry
     1/2           cup  almond 
       1                egg
       1           cup  sugar
       2   tablespoons  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

In large bowl combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Heat water, sour cream and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (With Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)
Prepare Almond Filling: Combine almond paste with 1 egg white. Beat with fork until blended. Stir in  , blanched almonds, toasted.
Punch dough down. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 9- W 16-inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2-inch of edges; sprinkle with cherries. Roll up from long side as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Form into ring and pinch ends to seal. Place ring, seam side down, on greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, 3/4 through dough, at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Bake at 375:F for 25 minutes or until done. Remove from baking sheet; cool on wire rack. Frost with Almond Icing.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/3           cup  flour
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1         pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1                egg 
       1    tablespoon  lemon rind
                        oil 
       1         pound  ricotta cheese
       1    tablespoon  citron
       2    tablespoon  chocolate chip
       2    tablespoon  sugar

PASTA: Combine flour, salt, sugar, citrus rind and butter and blend well. Add Marsala by the teaspoonful until dough is stiff. Chill for 2 hours. Roll dough on a lightly-floured board into a large rectangle. Cut into 4" squares. Wrap squares around cannoli tubes so that 2 corners fold over and two corners point outward. Brush the touching corners with egg white so that they will stick together. Deep fry in hot oil until golden. Cool and remove from tubes. Fill. Makes 10 to 12 cannoli. If you don't have cannoli tubes, make 2" diameter tubes out of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold dough accordingly. FILLING: Combine all ingredients and fill the cannoli.
